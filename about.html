 <p class="p">Sweet potatoes are perennial herbs of the family Caenorhabditis elegans, especially when referred to as food or crop. It was considered a traditional rhubarb crop along with potatoes because it is rich in carbohydrates and is resistant to pests, and it is a vegetable that is widely loved today for its rich sweetness. Sweet potatoes are used not only for food, but also for industrial purposes for sugar, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics production.</p>
 
 <p class="p">Unlike potatoes, which are difficult to eat raw, sweet potatoes can be easily eaten raw. It tastes similar to raw chestnuts. Raw sweet potatoes have a low sweetness and a dry taste, but unlike baked or steamed sweet potatoes, they taste different because they feel the juice of sweet potatoes.</p>
<p class="p">Unlike potatoes, which cannot be eaten when sprouts sprout, sweet potatoes can be eaten with confidence even when they sprout. This is because there is no lethal toxicity like solanin in potatoes.
    Sweet potatoes are able to eat roots, leaves, and stems. When fried, the tissue is cooked relatively sharp and hard compared to potatoes due to the fiber, but even if you take this into account, it can be used in a variety of recipes like potatoes.

In addition, potatoes are not roots but tuberous stems, especially eggplants and tomatoes.</p>
   
    <p>It is good for constipation because it has a lot of fiber, and yaraffin helps digestion, so it is surprisingly good for digestion compared to its dry texture. However, be careful because eating the skin will have too much fiber and cause more banggu to come out. As sweet potatoes are grown in soil, most of the skin is covered with soil, so it is better to remove it well. For this reason, marts sometimes package and sell washed sweet potatoes in small amounts. And it is said that it goes well with rice. Potato rice is more dangerous than white rice, especially for diabetics, while sweet potato rice's fiber is good for preventing blood sugar from rising.</p>
